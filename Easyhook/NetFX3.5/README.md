# Welcome to EasyHook - The reinvention of Windows API Hooking

This project supports extending (hooking) unmanaged code (APIs) with pure managed ones, from within a fully managed environment on 32- or 64-bit Windows XP SP2, Windows Vista x64, Windows Server 2008 x64, Windows 7, and Windows 8.1. 

EasyHook currently supports injecting assemblies built for .NET Framework 3.5 and 4.0 and can also inject native DLLs.
